# Order Management

We need you to build us a small single page application to edit existing orders.

## How it works

- We need to be able to see a list of existing orders (example orders can be found [here](./example-orders/)). When the user clicks on an order you will show us a detail page.
- If you land on the detail page of an order, we need see the items in the order (with description, price, ...) and order's total.
- We need to be able to remove a product from the order
- We need to be able to add an additional product to the order
- We need to have a button to make an order when the user clicks on the button once you will show a success message and whr the user clicks twice you will show a failure message.

By the way: you can assume we have a html and css guru in the house, who will pimp whatever you produced to an eye-catching level.
We need you to focus on the behavioral part.

## APIs

In the [example-orders](./example-orders/) directory, you can find a couple of example orders.en
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.
For now, you can use this dummy data, but make sure we can plug in the real api in easily.

In the [data](./data/) directory, you can find source files for customer data and product data, in case you need it.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.

To place the order, just log it on the console, but make sure we can plug in the real api endpoint easily.
